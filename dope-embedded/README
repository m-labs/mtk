                          DOPE GUI software stack
                          =======================


The DOpE GUI software stack is the software part of the Genode FPGA graphics
project. For more information on this project, please visit its official
website:

:website: [http://fpga-graphics.org]


Directory structure
===================

In the top-level directory, you find the following sub directories:

:'doc/':

  For creating custom applications using DOpE's application programming
  interface, the documentation provided in this directory is a good place
  to start.

:'lib/':

  This directory contains the graphics software stack including the widget
  implementation, graphics functions, and platform-specific device drivers.
  For each supported platform, there exists a subdirectory containing
  specific driver code and a Makefile for building the DOpE library for
  the platform.

:'include/':

  This directory contains the public header files of DOpE's application-
  programming interface.

:'test/':

  This directory contains a simple example application that runs on the
  Spartan3A(N) Starter Kits, the ML507, and on Linux via libSDL.

:'test_xilkernel/':

  This directory contains a simple example application that uses the 
  Xilkernel and runs on the Spartan3A(N) Starter Kits.


Building the DOpE library and test application
==============================================

For building the DOpE library for your platform, use the 'Makefile' provided
in the corresponding 'lib/<platform>/' directory or call make with the '-C'
argument. For example, the following command builds the
libSDL/Linux version of the DOpE library:
! make -C lib/sdl

Analogously, to build the test application for your platform, use the
'Makefile' in the corresponding 'test/<platform>/' directory.  Each time
when building the test program, the build process automatically revisits the
DOpE library. Thus, if you make changes to the library code you do not need
to rebuild the library explicitly.

Supported platforms
===================

At the current stage, the following platforms are supported:

:sdl: Linux with using libSDL as hardware-abstraction layer. When compiling
  DOpE for this platform, make sure that you have the libSDL development
  package installed on your Linux system.

:s3a_starter: Xilinx Spartan3A and Spartan3AN Starter Kits using the
  Microblaze soft core.

:ml507: Xilinx ML507 using the PowerPC 440 available in Virtex 5 devices.

Further resources
=================

The official version of DOpE is maintained by Genode Labs. For more
information and support, please refer to the following website:

Since its genesis in 2002 and until spring 2008, DOpE has been developed and
used as part of the TU Dresden's OS research project.  The subversion
repository of this project contains a valuable resource containing further
example applications.
