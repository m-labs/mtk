This directory contains platform-specific build-configuration files.
There are two kinds of files. Files prefixed with 'spec' contain small
configuration snippets, each covering a specific platform property such
as a certain CPU type. Files without the 'spec' prefix represent real
platforms.  The base name of the file is the name of the platform, which
is also used for defining the PLATFORM variable and corresponds to the
corresponding sub directories within the 'lib' and 'test' directories.
Typically platform-description files just aggregate the 'spec' files that
match the platform.
