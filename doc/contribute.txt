   How to submit patches for the inclusion into the official source tree
   =====================================================================


If you like to improve Genode FX in any way, you're more than welcome
to contribute. A collection of ideas to enhance the current
implementation can be found at the [http:wiki/Challenges - Challenges]
wiki page. If you prefer to improve the documentation, join in and use
the [http:wiki - wiki].

Genode FX is licensed to the community under the GNU GPL, but Genode Labs
reserves the right to also distribute derivates to customers under
closed-source licenses. [http:/about/licenses - Read more] about our
dual-licensing business model. Therefore, Genode Labs must ensure that
the redistribution of your contributions under non-GPL licenses is
legally allowed and ask you to either:

# Fill out and sign the [http:gca.pdf - Genode Contributor's Agreement]
  (GCA). The GCA enables Genode Labs to license Genode FX (including your
  contributions) under other licenses than the GPL. The signed GCA
  covers all your future contributions.

# Alternatively, if you don't want to sign the GCA, you may submit
  your contributions under the MIT License. This license is liberal and permits
  Genode Labs to use your contributions in open and closed-source projects.
  Please find the full text and description of the MIT License
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License - at Wikipedia].

The major difference between both variants (and maybe an advantage of
the GCA for you) is: The GCA permits only Genode Labs to relicense
your contributions, while the MIT license frees your code for use by
the public domain.


Development for Genode FX
#########################

The Genode FX source code is available via file releases and a public
subversion repository. Genode Labs will update the sources (incorporating
community contributions) and announce new releases. Therefore, the SVN
repository is not meant for active development but for convenient
source-code update and tracking of changes between releases.

The advantage of this approach is that only code that meets Genode
Labs's quality measures (tests, stability) becomes part of an official
release. The second (more legal) argument is that Genode Labs is obliged to
ensure all contributions fit our dual-licensing model.


Submission of your contribution
###############################

As soon as you developed a patch you regard valuable to share with the
community, submit it for incorporation. First, decide which of the
above contribution licensing variants fits your needs. Then, accompany
your patch with a proper description of its changes and send it to
the [http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=237260 - Genode FX mailing list].
Depending on your chosen licensing variant, you may have to state that your
source code is licensed under the MIT license.

Please, follow the developer discussion and possibly improve your
patch. The integration into Genode FX may take some time for review and
testing at Genode Labs.
